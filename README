Wordpress file manipulation dedector (v0.1a)


My idea and how it (should) work:
dedect local wordpress installation for file changes

  1. download local wordpress version from wordpress.org
  2. download all local installed wordpress plugins,  (if they downloadable)
  3. make file comparson between original and installed files
  4. mark all "only local files"
  5. mark all "changed files" and run diff over it
  6. generate simple html report


new:

  - added greps files to for level1, level2 and level3
    each line is a search pattern for the specified level3

  - scans upload folder for level1, 2 and 3 warnings
  

need todo:

  - cleanup code
  - make main method
  and much more...

ideas / improvements:

  - scan php files for some code snippets like "eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(...."
  - create a simple plugin architecture for scanner addons
