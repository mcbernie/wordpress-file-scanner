Wordpress file manipulation dedector (v0.1a)


My idea and how it (should) work:
dedect local wordpress installation for file changes

  1. download local wordpress version from wordpress.org
  2. download all local installed wordpress plugins,  (if they downloadable)
  3. make file comparson between original and installed files
  4. mark all "only local files"
  5. mark all "changed files" and run diff over it
  6. generate simple html report
